      <p align="center"><font size="5">Get 50% of your trades wrong and still 
        <br>
        make big profits in the stock market.</font></p>
      <p align="center"><font size="4">We'll show you exactly when to buy and 
        sell stocks with a proven method used by professional traders.</font></p>
      <p>Our approach to profiting in the stock market is a simple, but powerful 
        strategy. We buy stocks which demonstrate the potential for explosive 
        gains, while maintaining a highly disciplined exit strategy to manage 
        risk.</p>
      <p>You see, while everyone is always focused on the goal of how much they 
        can make buying or shorting a stock, they forget to concern themselves 
        with how much they risk losing. <b>The secret to creating great wealth 
        in the stock market, isn't big gains; it's small losses.</b> <br>
        <br>
        By focusing on your potential risk and identifying your exit plan should 
        your trade go against you, it is easy to keep emotions out of the game 
        allowing you to think clearly and stick to your trading plan. </p>
      <p>By itself, that strategy is not enough to be successful. You also need 
        to have a <b>proven and consistent strategy</b> that will allow you to 
        find winning stocks in any market environment. At Hot Stix, we use a visual 
        form of Technical Analysis that is both simple and effective. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Technical Analysis allows us to find setups by identifying certain chart 
        patterns. Some people think Technical Analysis needs to be complex and 
        mathematical. We think it's better to keep it simple. Our practice was 
        discovered more than 50 years ago, and has proven itself to work in every 
        market environment. <br>
        <br>
        Here is a sample of how it works:<br>
      </p>
      <p><b>EXAMPLE OF OUR SERVICE:</b></p>
      <p> This is an actual buy recommendation we made on the stock Yahoo (YHOO) 
        in November of 2001.</p>
      <p align="left"><font size="4">Step 1)</font> First we identify the setup 
        and alert our members ahead of time to a potential trade. We identified 
        a pattern on the chart and told our members to BUY this stock when it 
        crossed over the upper blue line. </p>
      <p align="center"><br>
        <img src="../images/yhoo1.gif" width="320" height="218"> </p>
      <p><br>
        <font size="4">Step 2)</font> Once the trade is activated, we post follow 
        up commentary as the trade unfolds. Here, the buy is triggered and we 
        follow along with periodic updates so you are never left in the dark.</p>
      <p align="center"><br>
        <img src="../images/yhoo2.gif" width="320" height="218"> </p>
      <p align="left"><br>
        <font size="4">Step 3)</font> When the stock reaches our target price, 
        we close out the trade. We follow all of our recommendations from start 
        to finish, even the ones that don't work out as perfect as this one did. 
        Unlike most services, ALL of our past trade recommendations are fully 
        available for your review.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="center"> <img src="/images/yhoo3.gif" width="320" height="218"></p>
      <p><br>
        In a matter of a few days, we made a profit of 25% on that one trade. 
        Obviously, not all of our trades go exactly as planned. In fact, a good 
        majority of our trades do not meet our goals. However, we employ a strategy 
        that keeps our losses small. Typically, if the trade goes south, we will 
        exit for a small loss of less than 5%. </p>
      <p><b>This strategy of keeping losses small is extremely effective. </b></p>
      <p>If you win only 1 out of 3 times, with your losers losing 5% and your 
        winners gaining 25%, you can make extremely large profits. That's right 
        -- just like in baseball, you don't need a high batting average to make 
        the all star team. <br>
        <br>
        Let's do the math assuming there are only 1 out of 3 winners. Say you 
        make 9 trades of $10,000 each in one month. That means you'll lose money 
        on 6 and make money on only 3. The 6 losers will cost you $3,000 (6 x 
        5% loss on each of the $10,000 trades) and the 3 winners will net you 
        $7,500 (3 x 25% gain on each of the $10,000 trades) for a total profit 
        of $4,500. Keep that up consistently, and pretty soon you'll be owning 
        your own baseball team. <br>
        <br>
        <b>Want proof this works? </b><br>
        <br>
        Our total gain of all trades since inception over three years ago is 723.7%. 
        (Data is up to October 2005 and does not include commission costs. Past 
        performance is no guarantee of future results.) That didn't come from 
        a few big home runs, but from many, many singles and doubles and a disciplined 
        exit strategy that also kept us from any major catastrophes. <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        The benefits to practicing technical analysis go beyond merely providing 
        an opportunity for extraordinary profits and gains in wealth. </p>
      <p>Followers of Technical Analysis also enjoy the:<br>
        <br>
        *Ability to profit in both a bull and a bear market.</p>
      <p><br>
        *Opportunity for extraordinary profits and gains in wealth.</p>
      <p>*Minimization of risk. Never again will you ride a stock down for big 
        losses.<br>
        <br>
        *The clarity and comfort that come from following a successfully tested 
        and logical strategy.</p>

        <b>OUR SERVICES</b></p>
      <p>At Hot Stix, we do our best to provide to make technical analysis as 
        clear and easy to follow as possible. There are a lot of services that 
        offer very general market advice. At Hot Stix, we believe in providing 
        specific details, like exact entry, exit and stop prices.<br>
        <br>
        Once you become a member, you will have immediate access to the following 
        services:</p>
      <p> <b><img src="/images/icons/hotbox.gif" width="124" height="22"> </b> 
        <br>
        This is our dynamic online service that will provide you with a continuously 
        updated list of stocks to buy and short. We don't just tell you a stock 
        is a "Strong Buy." We tell you exactly at what price to buy and also tell 
        you specifically where to exit the trade. This can be done easily enough 
        with most online brokerages through the use of a stop-limit order. Once 
        we recommend a stock, we continue to chart the progress of the trade. 
        Every few days, sometimes every few hours, we will post a new chart and 
        new analysis of the trade and change our sell position as needed. We keep 
        all of this information in what we call <a href="javascript:PopUp2();">The 
        Hot Box</a>.<br>
        <!-- <b><img src="/images/icons/email.gif" width="87" height="23"> 
        </b> <br>
        As a premium member, you'll have the option to receive an alert each time 
        the Hot Box is updated. This way, if we change our position on a certain 
        stock, you will be notified immediately. -->
        <br>
        <br>
        <b><img src="/images/icons/newsletter.gif" width="187" height="23"><br>
        </b>Once a week, we step back to take a look at the big picture. In the 
        Hot Stix newsletter, we take a look at key market indices, to get a sense 
        of the current risk level of the market as a whole. It is through these 
        weekly market snapshots that an investor can easily avoid getting caught 
        in a major market decline. </p>
      <p><b><img src="/images/icons/charts.gif" width="92" height="21"> </b> <br>
        One of the biggest misconceptions in technical analysis is that it is 
        hard to understand because the charts are confusing. Hot Stix will provide 
        you with a &quot;candlestick&quot; chart that is easy to read and comprehend 
        for every trade we make. We'll even update the chart if we change our 
        target price. We write our comments directly on the chart and use clear 
        and concise lines to illustrate key inflection points. You will never 
        look at a chart the same way again. </p>
      <p><img src="../images/icons/email.gif" width="87" height="23"></p>
      <p>Hot Stix is convenient and easy to follow. We offer <b>free e-mail alerts</b>

                &quot;I'm a short-term momentum trader who is a recent subscriber 
                to your website. I take positions on the small risk, large potential 
                reward recommendations, which I recently did on NVDA. In 22 days, 
                I netted $8,468.63 by shorting NVDA, <b>enough to pay for more 
                than 24 YEARS of subscriptions</b> to your site !! Can't thank 
                you enough. I demand that you all keep up the good work!&quot;</p>

              <p>&quot;I have been a member for about five months, and just wanted 
                to tell you how much I have enjoyed the service. I have been doing 
                this long enough to know that there is no get rich scheme, and 
                that is not what I am looking for. Rather, I would be happy if 
                I could consistently make a little money. That is something that 
                I have been able to do since joining Hot Stix. Trading still has 
                it's daily struggles, I still find it tempting to utilize a mental 
                stop that almost always leads to a larger loss. But for the most 
                part, I have had the discipline to exercise good money management 
                skills. Thanks again for the great setups, and I look forward 
                to continued trading with Hot Stix.&quot;<br>

              <p>&quot;I subscribed to your service about a month ago, and boy 
                I am impressed. I started investing about 2.5 years ago. I unfortunately 
                bought into the buy and hold philosophy. I lost close to 50% of 
                my portfolio. Within in a months time I made 500 dollars based 
                on your setups.<strong> I am now big believer in technical analysis, 
                and I learned that it is okay to sell your stocks.</strong> These 
                analyst and so called financial experts can learn a ton from you 
                guys. I know you guys aren't right all of the time, but your strategy 
                of risk management makes losses small. <strong>Why don't the guys 
                on MSNBC use your philosophy? I never hear these guys tell you 
                to short a certain stock</strong>. They always tell you to buy 
                a stock, but they never give you any entrance or exit points. 
                I could have been an analyst, make a hundred grand a year, tell 
                people to buy stocks that are going south and have no accountability, 
                boy what an easy job.&quot;<br>
