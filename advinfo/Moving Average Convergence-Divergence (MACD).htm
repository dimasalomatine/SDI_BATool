      <H2>Introduction</H2>
      <P>Developed by Gerald Appel, Moving Average Convergence/Divergence (MACD) 
      is one of the simplest and most reliable indicators available. MACD uses 
      <A title="Glossary: moving average" 
      href="http://www.stockcharts.com/education/GlossaryM.html#MovingAverage">moving 
      averages</A>, which are lagging indicators, to include some 
      trend-following characteristics. These lagging indicators are turned into 
      a momentum oscillator by subtracting the longer moving average from the 
      shorter moving average. The resulting plot forms a line that oscillates 
      above and below zero, without any upper or lower limits. MACD is a 
      centered oscillator and the <A 
      href="http://www.stockcharts.com/education/IndicatorAnalysis/indicators3.html#centeredosc">guidelines</A> 
      for using centered oscillators apply.</P><A name=macdformula></A>

      <P>The most popular formula for the "standard" MACD is the difference 
      between a security's 26-day and 12-day exponential moving averages. This 
      is the formula that is used in many popular technical analysis programs, 
      including <A 
      href="http://stockcharts.com/charts/SharpCharts/">SharpCharts</A>, and 
      quoted in most technical analysis books on the subject. Appel and others 
      have since tinkered with these original settings to come up with a MACD 
      that is better suited for faster or slower securities. Using shorter 
      moving averages will produce a quicker, more responsive indicator, while 
      using longer moving averages will produce a slower indicator, less prone 
      to whipsaws. For our purposes in this article, the traditional 12/26 MACD 
      will be used for explanations. Later in the indicator series, we will 
      address the use of different moving averages in calculating MACD. </P>
      <P>Of the two moving averages that make up MACD, the 12-day EMA is the 
      faster and the 26-day EMA is the slower. Closing prices are used to form 
      the moving averages. Usually, a 9-day EMA of MACD is plotted along side to 
      act as a trigger line. A bullish crossover occurs when MACD moves above 
      its 9-day EMA and a bearish crossover occurs when MACD moves below its 
      9-day EMA. The Merrill Lynch chart below shows the 12-day EMA (thin blue 
      line) with the 26-day EMA (thin red line) overlaid the price plot. MACD 
      appears in the box below as the thick black line and its 9-day EMA is the 
      thin blue line. The histogram represents the difference between MACD and 
      its 9-day EMA. The histogram is positive when MACD is above its 9-day EMA 
      and negative when MACD is below its 9-day EMA.</P>

      <H2>What does MACD do?</H2>
      <P>MACD measures the difference between two moving averages. A positive 
      MACD indicates that the 12-day EMA is trading above the 26-day EMA. A 
      negative MACD indicates that the 12-day EMA is trading below the 26-day 
      EMA. If MACD is positive and rising, then the gap between the 12-day EMA 
      and the 26-day EMA is widening. This indicates that the rate-of-change of 
      the faster moving average is higher than the rate-of-change for the slower 
      moving average. Positive momentum is increasing and this would be 
      considered bullish. If MACD is negative and declining further, then the 
      negative gap between the faster moving average (green) and the slower 
      moving average (blue) is expanding. Downward momentum is accelerating and 
      this would be considered bearish. MACD centerline crossovers occur when 
      the faster moving average crosses the slower moving average.</P>

      width=517 border=1> </P>
      <P>This Merrill Lynch chart shows MACD as a solid black line and its 9-day 
      EMA as the thin blue line. Even though moving averages are lagging 
      indicators, notice that MACD moves faster than the moving averages. In 
      this example with Merrill Lynch, MACD also provided a few good trading 
      signals as well.</P>
      <OL>
        <LI>In March and April, MACD turned down ahead of both moving averages 
        and formed a negative divergence ahead of the price peak. 
        <LI>In May and June, MACD began to strengthen and make higher lows while 
        both moving averages continued to make lower lows. 
        <LI>And finally, MACD formed a positive divergence in October while both 
        moving averages recorded new lows. </LI></OL><A name=bullishsignals></A>
      <H2>MACD Bullish Signals</H2>
      <P>MACD generates bullish signals from three main sources:</P>
      <OL>
        <LI>Positive divergence 
        <LI>Bullish moving average crossover 
        <LI>Bullish centerline crossover </LI></OL>

      src="Moving Average Convergence-Divergence (MACD)_files/ta-macd1-nvls1.png" 
      width=516 border=1></P>
      <P>A positive divergence occurs when MACD begins to advance and the 
      security is still in a downtrend and makes a lower reaction low. MACD can 
      either form as a series of higher lows or a second low that is higher than 
      the previous low. Positive divergences are probably the least common of 
      the three signals, but are usually the most reliable and lead to the 
      biggest moves.</P>
      <H3><A name=bmacross></A>Bullish Moving Average Crossover</H3>
      <P><STRONG></STRONG><IMG height=400 
      alt="Novellus Systems, Inc. (NVLS) MACD example chart from StockCharts.com" 
      hspace=0 
      src="Moving Average Convergence-Divergence (MACD)_files/ta-macd1-nvls2.png" 
      width=516 border=1></P>
      <P>A bullish moving average crossover occurs when MACD moves above its 
      9-day EMA or trigger line. Bullish moving average crossovers are probably 
      the most common signals and as such are the least reliable. If not used in 
      conjunction with other technical analysis tools, these crossovers can lead 
      to <A 
      href="http://www.stockcharts.com/education/GlossaryW.html#Whipsaw">whipsaws</A> 
      and many false signals. Moving average crossovers are sometimes used to 
      confirm a positive divergence. The second low or higher low of a positive 
      divergence can be considered valid when it is followed by a bullish moving 
      average crossover.</P>
      <P>Sometimes it is prudent to apply a price filter to the moving average 
      crossover in order to ensure that it will hold. An example of a price 
      filter would be to buy if MACD breaks above the 9-day EMA and remains 
      above for three days. The buy signal would then commence at the end of the 
      third day.</P>
      <H3><A name=bucentercross></A>Bullish Centerline Crossover</H3>
      <P><IMG height=401 
      alt="Apple Computer, Inc. (AAPL) MACD example chart from StockCharts.com" 
      hspace=0 
      src="Moving Average Convergence-Divergence (MACD)_files/ta-macd1-aapl.png" 
      width=516 border=1></P>
      <P>A bullish centerline crossover occurs when MACD moves above the zero 
      line and into positive territory. This is a clear indication that momentum 
      has changed from negative to positive, or from bearish to bullish. After a 
      positive divergence and bullish moving average crossover, the centerline 
      crossover can act as a confirmation signal. Of the three signals, moving 
      average crossover are probably the second most common signals.</P>

      width=518 border=1></P>
      <P>Even though some traders may use only one of the above signals to form 
      a buy or a sell signal, using a combination can generate more robust 
      signals. In the Halliburton example, all three bullish signals were 
      present and the stock still advanced another 20%. The stock formed a lower 
      low at the end of February, but MACD formed a higher low, thus creating a 
      potential positive divergence. MACD then formed a bullish crossover by 
      moving above its 9-day EMA. And finally, MACD traded above zero to form a 
      bullish centerline crossover. At the time of the bullish centerline 
      crossover, the stock was trading at 32 1/4 and went above 40 immediately 
      after that. In August, the stock traded above 50.&nbsp;</P><A

      negative divergence in MACD can take the form of either a lower high or a 
      straight decline. Negative divergences are probably the least common of 
      the three signals, but are usually the most reliable and can warn of an 
      impending peak.</P>

      <P>The FDX chart shows a negative divergence when MACD formed a lower high 
      in May and the stock formed a higher high at the same time. This was a 
      rather blatant negative divergence and signaled that momentum was slowing. 
      A few days later, the stock broke the uptrend line and MACD formed a lower 
      low.</P>
      <P>There are two possible means of confirming a negative divergence. 
      First, the indicator can form a lower low. This is traditional 
      peak-and-trough analysis applied to an indicator. With the lower high and 
      subsequent lower low, the up trend for MACD has changed from bullish to 
      bearish. Second, a bearish moving average crossover, which is explained 
      below, can act to confirm a negative divergence. As long as MACD is 
      trading above its 9-day <A title="Glossary: moving average" 
      href="http://www.stockcharts.com/education/GlossaryM.html#MovingAverage">EMA</A> 
      or trigger line, it has not turned down and the lower high is difficult to 
      confirm. When MACD breaks below its 9-day EMA, it signals that the 
      short-term trend for the indicator is weakening, and a possible interim 
      peak has formed.</P>
      <H3><A name=bearmacross></A>Bearish moving average crossover</H3>
      <P><STRONG></STRONG>The most common signal for MACD is the moving average 
      crossover. A bearish moving average crossover occurs when MACD declines 
      below its 9-day EMA. Not only are these signals the most common, but they 
      also produce the most false signals. As such, moving average crossovers 
      should be confirmed with other signals to avoid <A 
      title="Glossary: whipsaw" 
      href="http://www.stockcharts.com/education/GlossaryW.html#Whipsaw">whipsaws</A> 
      and false readings.</P>

      width=517 border=1></P>
      <P>Sometimes a stock can be in a strong uptrend and MACD will remain above 
      its trigger line for a sustained period of time. In this case, it is 
      unlikely that a negative divergence will develop. A different signal is 
      needed to identify a potential change in momentum. This was the case with 
      MRK in February and March. The stock advanced in a strong up trend and 
      MACD remained above its 9-day EMA for 7 weeks. When a bearish moving 
      average crossover occurred, it signaled that upside momentum was slowing. 
      This slowing momentum should have served as an alert to monitor the 
      technical situation for further clues of weakness. Weakness was soon 
      confirmed when the stock broke its uptrend line and MACD continued its 
      decline and moved below zero.</P>
      <H3><A name=bearcentercross></A>Bearish centerline crossover</H3>
      <P><STRONG></STRONG>A bearish centerline crossover occurs when MACD moves 
      below zero and into negative territory. This is a clear indication that 
      momentum has changed from positive to negative, or from bullish to 
      bearish. The centerline crossover can act as an independent signal, or 
      confirm a prior signal such as a moving average crossover or negative 
      divergence. Once MACD crosses into negative territory, momentum, at least 
      for the short term, has turned bearish.</P>

      src="Moving Average Convergence-Divergence (MACD)_files/ta-macd2-uis.png"

      <P>The significance of the centerline crossover will depend on the 
      previous movements of MACD as well. If MACD is positive for many weeks, 
      begins to trend down and then crosses into negative territory, it would be 
      considered bearish. However, if MACD has been negative for a few months, 
      breaks above zero and then back below, it may be seen as more of a 
      correction. In order to judge the significance of a centerline crossover, 
      traditional technical analysis can be applied to see if there has been a 
      change in trend, higher high or lower low. </P>
      <P>The UIS chart depicts a bearish centerline crossover that preceded a 
      25% drop in the stock that occurs just off the right edge of the chart. 
      Although there was little time to act once this signal appeared, there 
      were other warnings signs just prior to the dramatic drop.</P>

        crossover formed. 
        <LI>When the stock rebounded from the drop, MACD did not even break

      <P>In addition to the signal mentioned above, the bearish centerline 
      crossover occurred after MACD had been above zero for almost two months. 
      Since 20-Sept, MACD had been weakening and momentum was slowing. The break 
      below zero acted as the final straw of a long weakening process.</P><A

      <H2>Combining Signals</H2>
      <P>As with bullish MACD signals, bearish signals can be combined to create 
      more robust signals. In most cases, stocks fall faster than they rise. 
      This was definitely the case with UIS and only two bearish MACD signals 
      were present. Using momentum indicators like MACD, technical analysis can 
      sometimes provide clues to impending weakness. While it may be impossible 
      to predict the length and duration of the decline, being able to spot 
      weakness can enable traders to take a more defensive position. </P>

      <P>One of the primary benefits of MACD is that it incorporates aspects of 
      both momentum and trend in one indicator. As a trend-following indicator, 
      it will not be wrong for very long. The use of <A 
      title="Glossary: moving average" 
      href="http://www.stockcharts.com/education/GlossaryM.html#MovingAverage">moving 
      averages</A> ensures that the indicator will eventually follow the 
      movements of the underlying security. By using exponential moving 
      averages, as opposed to simple moving averages, some of the lag has been 
      taken out.</P>
      <P>As a <A title="Glossary: momentum" 
      href="http://www.stockcharts.com/education/GlossaryM.html#Momentum">momentum</A> 
      indicator, MACD has the ability to foreshadow moves in the underlying 
      security. MACD <A title="Glossary: divergence" 
      href="http://www.stockcharts.com/education/GlossaryD.html#Divergence">divergences</A> 
      can be key factors in predicting a trend change. A negative divergence 
      signals that bullish momentum is waning and there could be a potential 
      change in trend from bullish to bearish. This can serve as an alert for 
      traders to take some profits in long positions, or for aggressive traders 
      to consider initiating a short position.</P>
      <P>MACD can be applied to daily, weekly or monthly charts. MACD represents 
      the convergence and divergence of two moving averages. The standard 
      setting for MACD is the difference between the 12 and 26-period EMA. 
      However, any combination of moving averages can be used. The set of moving 
      averages used in MACD can be tailored for each individual security. For 
      weekly charts, a faster set of moving averages may be appropriate. For 
      volatile stocks, slower moving averages may be needed to help smooth the 
      data. No matter what the characteristics of the underlying security, each 
      individual can set MACD to suit his or her own trading style, objectives 
      and risk tolerance.</P><A name=macddrawbacks></A>
      <H2>MACD Drawbacks</H2>
      <P>One of the beneficial aspects of MACD may also be a drawback. Moving 
      averages, be they simple, exponential or weighted, are lagging indicators. 
      Even though MACD represents the difference between two moving averages, 
      there can still be some lag in the indicator itself. This is more likely 
      to be the case with weekly charts than daily charts. One solution to this 
      problem is the use of the <A 
      href="http://www.stockcharts.com/education/IndicatorAnalysis/indic_MACD4.html#histogram">MACD-Histogram</A>.</P>
      <P>MACD is not particularly good for identifying overbought and oversold 
      levels. Even though it is possible to identify levels that historically 
      represent overbought and oversold levels, MACD does not have any upper or 
      lower limits to bind its movement. MACD can continue to overextend beyond 
      historical extremes.</P>
      <P>MACD calculates the absolute difference between two moving averages and 
      not the percentage difference. MACD is calculated by subtracting one 
      moving average from the other. As a security increases in price, the 
      difference (both positive and negative) between the two moving averages is 
      destined to grow. This makes its difficult to compare MACD levels over a 
      long period of time, especially for stocks that have grown 
      exponentially.</P>
      <P><IMG

      border=1></P>
      <P>The AMZN chart demonstrates the difficult in comparing MACD levels over 
      a long period of time. Before 1999, AMZN's MACD is barely recognizable and 
      appears to trade close to the zero line. MACD was indeed quite volatile at 
      the time, but this volatility has been dwarfed since the stock rose from 
      below 20 to almost 100.</P>
      <P>An alternative is to use the Price Oscillator, which find the 
      percentage difference between two moving averages:</P>
      <P><CODE>(12 day EMA - 26 day EMA) / (26 day EMA) </CODE></P>
      <P><CODE>(20 - 18) / 18 = .11 or +11%</CODE></P>
      <P>The resulting percentage difference can be compared over a longer 
      period of time. On the AMZN chart, we can see that the Price Oscillator 
      provides a better means for a long-term comparison. For the short term, 
      MACD and the Price Oscillator are basically the same. The shape of the 
      lines, the divergences, moving average crossovers and centerline 
      crossovers for MACD and the Price Oscillator are virtually 
      identical.</P><A name=macdconclusion></A>
      <H2>Pros and Cons of the MACD</H2>
      <P>Since Gerald Appel developed MACD, there have been hundreds of new 
      indicators introduced to technical analysis. While many indicators have 
      come and gone, MACD is an oscillator that has stood the test of time. The 
      concept behind its use is straightforward and its construction simple, yet 
      it remains one of the most reliable indicators around. The effectiveness 
      of MACD will vary for different securities and markets. The lengths of the 
      moving averages can be adapted for a better fit to a particular security 
      or market. As with all indicators , MACD is not infallible and should be 
      used in conjunction with other technical analysis tools.</P><A

      <H2>MACD-Histogram</H2>
      <P>In 1986, Thomas Aspray developed the MACD-Histogram. Some of his 
      findings were presented in a series of articles for <STRONG>Technical 
      Analysis of Stocks and Commodities</STRONG>. Aspray noted that MACD would 
      sometimes lag important moves in a security, especially when applied to 
      weekly charts. He first experimented by changing the moving averages and 
      found that shorter moving averages did indeed speed up the signals. 
      However, he was looking for a means to anticipate MACD crossovers. One of 
      the answers he came up with was the MACD-Histogram. </P>

      width=500 border=1></P><A name=histdefinition></A>
      <H2>Definition and Construction</H2>
      <P>The MACD-Histogram represents the difference between <A 
      title="Glossary: MACD" 
      href="http://www.stockcharts.com/education/GlossaryM.html#MACD">MACD</A> 
      and the 9-day <A title="Glossary: moving average" 
      href="http://www.stockcharts.com/education/GlossaryM.html#MovingAverage">EMA</A> 
      of MACD, which can also be referred to as the signal or trigger line. The 
      plot of this difference is presented as a histogram, making centerline 
      crossovers and divergences are easily identifiable. A centerline crossover 
      for the MACD-Histogram is the same as a moving average crossover for MACD. 
      If you will recall, a moving average crossover occurs when MACD moves 
      above or below the signal line.</P>
      <P>If the value of MACD is larger than the value of its 9-day EMA, then 
      the value on the MACD-Histogram will be positive. Conversely, if the value 
      of MACD is less than its 9-day EMA, then the value on the MACD-Histogram 
      will be negative.</P>
      <P>Further increases or decreases in the gap between MACD and its 9-day 
      EMA will be reflected in the MACD-Histogram. Sharp increases in the 
      MACD-Histogram indicate that MACD is rising faster than its 9-day EMA and 
      bullish momentum is strengthening. Sharp declines in the MACD-Histogram 
      indicate that MACD is falling faster than its 9-day EMA and bearish 
      momentum is increasing.</P>

      width=496 border=1></P>
      <P>On the chart above, we can see that MACD-Histogram movements are 
      relatively independent of the actual MACD. Sometimes MACD is rising while 
      the MACD-Histogram is falling. At other times, MACD is falling while 
      MACD-Histogram is rising. MACD-Histogram does not reflect the absolute 
      value of MACD, but rather the value of MACD relative to its 9-day EMA. 
      Usually, but not always, a move in MACD is preceded by a corresponding 
      divergence in MACD-Histogram.</P>

      <H2>Usage</H2>
      <P>Thomas Aspray designed the MACD-Histogram as a tool to anticipate a 
      moving average crossover in MACD. Divergences between MACD and the 
      MACD-Histogram are the main tool used to anticipate moving average 
      crossovers. A positive divergence in the MACD-Histogram indicates that 
      MACD is strengthening and could be on the verge of a bullish moving 
      average crossover. A negative divergence in the MACD-Histogram indicates 
      that MACD is weakening and can act to foreshadow a bearish moving average 
      crossover in MACD.</P>
      <P>In his book, <A 
      href="http://store.yahoo.com/stockcharts/teanoffimajo.html">Technical 
      Analysis of the Financial Markets</A>, John Murphy asserts that the 
      MACD-Histogram is best used to identify periods when the gap between MACD 
      and its 9-day EMA is either widening or shrinking. Broadly speaking, a 
      widening gap indicates strengthening momentum and a shrinking gap 
      indicates weakening momentum. Usually a change in the MACD-Histogram will 
      precede any changes in MACD.</P><A name=histsignals></A>
      <H2>Signals</H2>
      <P>The main signal generated by the MACD-Histogram is a divergence 
      followed by a moving average crossover. A bullish signal is generated when 
      a positive divergence forms and there is a bullish centerline crossover. A 
      bearish signal is generated when there is a negative divergence and a 
      bearish centerline crossover. Keep in mind that a <STRONG>centerline 
      crossover</STRONG> for the MACD-Histogram represents a <STRONG>moving 
      average crossover</STRONG> for MACD.</P>
      <P>Divergences can take many forms and varying degrees. Generally 
      speaking, two types of divergences have been identified: the slant 
      divergence and the peak-trough divergence. </P>
      <P><IMG height=402 
      alt="Unisys Corp. (UIS) MACD example chart from StockCharts.com" hspace=0 
      src="Moving Average Convergence-Divergence (MACD)_files/ta-macd4-uis.png" 
      width=516 border=1></P>
      <P>A slant divergence forms when there is a continuous and relatively 
      smooth move in one direction (up or down) to form the divergence. Slant 
      divergences generally cover a shorter time frame than divergences formed 
      with two peaks or two troughs. A slant divergence can contain some small 
      bumps (peaks or troughs) along the way. The world of technical analysis is 
      not perfect and there are exceptions to most rules and hybrids for many 
      signals. </P>

      src="Moving Average Convergence-Divergence (MACD)_files/ta-macd4-ge.png" 
      width=516 border=1></P>
      <P>A peak-trough divergence occurs when at least two peaks or two troughs 
      develop in one direction to form the divergence. A series of two or more 
      rising troughs (higher lows) can form a positive divergence and a series 
      of two or more declining peaks (lower highs) can form a negative 
      divergence. Peak-trough divergences usually cover a longer time frame than 
      slant divergences. On a daily chart, a peak-trough divergence can cover a 
      time frame as short as two weeks or as long as several months. </P>
      <P>Usually, the longer and sharper the divergence is, the better any 
      ensuing signal will be. Short and shallow divergences can lead to false 
      signals and whipsaws. In addition, it would appear that peak-trough 
      divergences are a bit more reliable than slant divergences. Peak-trough 
      divergences tend to be sharper and cover a longer time frame than slant 
      divergences.</P><A name=histbenefits></A>
      <H2>MACD-Histogram Benefits</H2>
      <P>The main benefit of the MACD-Histogram is its ability to anticipate 
      MACD signals. Divergences usually appear in the MACD-Histogram before MACD 
      moving average crossovers. Armed with this knowledge, traders and 
      investors can better prepare for potential trend changes.</P>
      <P>MACD-Histogram can be applied to daily, weekly or monthly charts. 
      (Note: This may require some tinkering with the number of periods used to 
      form the original MACD; shorter or faster moving averages may be required 
      for weekly and monthly charts.) Using weekly charts, the broad underlying 
      trend of a stock can be determined. Once the broad trend has been 
      determined, daily charts can be used to time entry and exit 
strategies.</P>
      <P>In <A 
      href="http://store.yahoo.com/stockcharts/teanoffimajo.html">Technical 
      Analysis of the Financial Markets</A>, John Murphy advocates this type of 
      two-tiered approach to investing in order to avoid making trades against 
      the major trend. The weekly MACD-Histogram can be used to generate a 
      long-term signal in order to establish the tradable trend. Then only 
      short-term signals that agree with the major trend would be considered. If 
      the long-term trend were bullish, only negative divergences with bearish 
      centerline crossovers would be considered valid for the MACD-Histogram. If 
      the long-term trend were bearish, only positive divergences with bullish 
      centerline crossovers would be considered valid.</P>

      <P>On the IBM weekly chart, the MACD-Histogram generated four signals. 
      Before each moving average crossover in MACD, a corresponding divergence 
      formed in the MACD-Histogram. To make adjustments for the weekly chart, 
      the moving averages have been shortened to 6 and 12. This MACD is formed 
      by subtracting the 6-week EMA from the 12-week EMA. A 6-week EMA has been 
      used as the trigger. The MACD-Histogram is calculated by taking the 
      difference between MACD (6/12) and the 6-day EMA of MACD (6/12).</P>
      <OL>
        <LI>The first signal was a bearish moving average crossover in Jan-99. 
        From its peak in late Nov-98, the MACD-Histogram formed a negative 
        divergence that preceded the bearish moving average crossover in MACD. 
        <LI>The second signal was a bullish moving average crossover in April. 
        From its low in mid-February, the MACD-Histogram formed a positive 
        divergence that preceded the bullish moving average crossover in MACD. 
        <LI>The third signal was a bearish moving average crossover in late 
        July. From its May peak, the MACD-Histogram formed a negative divergence 
        that preceded a bearish moving average crossover in MACD. 
        <LI>The final signal was a bullish moving average crossover, which was 
        preceded by a slight positive divergence in MACD-Histogram. </LI></OL>
      <P>The third signal was based on a peak-trough divergence. Two readily 
      identifiable and consecutive lower peaks formed to create the divergence. 
      The peaks and troughs on the previous divergences, although identifiable, 
      do not stand out as much.</P><A name=histdrawbacks></A>
      <H2>MACD-Histogram Drawbacks</H2>
      <P>The MACD-Histogram is an indicator of an indicator or a derivative of a 
      derivative. MACD is the first derivative of the price action of a security 
      and the MACD-Histogram is the second derivative of the price action of a 
      security. As the second derivative, the MACD-Histogram is further removed 
      from the actual price action of the underlying security. The further 
      removed an indicator is from the underlying price action, the greater the 
      chances of false signals. Keep in mind that this is an indicator of an 
      indicator. MACD-Histogram should not be compared directly with the price 
      action of the underlying security.</P>
      <P>Because MACD-Histogram was designed to anticipate MACD signals, there 
      may be a temptation to jump the gun. The MACD-Histogram should be used in 
      conjunction with other aspects of technical analysis. This will help to 
      alleviate the temptation for early entry. Another means to guard against 
      early entry is to combine weekly signals with daily signals. There will of 
      course be more daily signals than weekly signals. However, by using only 
      the daily signals that agree with the weekly signals, there will be fewer 
      daily signals to act on. By acting only on those daily signals that are in 
      agreement with the weekly signals, you are also assured of trading with 
      the longer trend and not against it.</P>
      <P>Be careful of small and shallow divergences. While these may sometimes 
      lead to good signals, they are also more apt to create false signals. One 
      method to avoid small divergences is to look for larger divergences with 
      two or more readily identifiable peaks or troughs. Compare the peaks and 
      troughs from past action to determine significance. Only peaks and troughs 
      that appear to be significant should warrant attention.</P><A

      <H2>MACD and SharpCharts2</H2>
      <P><IMG height=76 
      alt="SharpCharts2 application MACD example image from StockCharts.com"

      width=357 border=0></P>
      <P>Using SharpCharts2, MACD can be set as an indicator above or below a 
      security's price plot. Once the indicator is chosen from the drop down 
      list, the three boxes to the right are used to adjust the settings. The 
      default setting is (12,26,9), which automatically appears. The default 
      would use a 12-day EMA and 26-day EMA to calculate MACD and a 9-day EMA of 
      MACD as the signal/trigger line. MACD appears as the thick solid line and 
      the signal/trigger line as the thinner and smoother line. Typically, MACD 
      crosses above and below its signal line as it fluctuates around the zero 
      line. </P>
      <P>The histogram is the MACD-Histogram, which measures the difference 
      between MACD and its signal/trigger line. Simply charting the MACD 
      indicator will also create a MACD histogram as an overlay, or you can 
      chart the histogram separately by selecting it from the drop-down menu. 
      The scale shows the range of values for MACD. Stocks with low prices 
      (e.g., between 10 and 20) will have a smaller MACD range and stocks with 
      high prices (e.g., above 100) will have a higher MACD range.</P>
